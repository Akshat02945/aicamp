# Introduction

This is a first course in mathematics with emphasis on helping a learner with a bunch of tools and techniques required for studying several aspects of data sciences. We will illustrate the ideas through questions and puzzles. We would like to replace theorems with intuition and give pointers to inspired students to look up material for further study. By the end of the course, the student will be confident on the basics of linear algebra and probability. The course will end with a couple of exemplary ideas in data sciences and the importance of the math thus studied. 


# Expectations from the course
An important aspect of any course that is heavy on math, is to develop confidence to read up abstract material. The symbolc manipulation and logical reasoning are toolkits to infer unambiguously. It helps to stay confident and continuously interact with peers/TAs/Professor. Expect the material to be hard on your minds to begin with, but one will surely feel comfortable with time. An important tip is to take a relook at a mathematical concept multiple times, asking what is the question for which the concept is an answer. It helps to solve questions that challenge your conceptual understanding than solve multiple problems of similar type.  


# Grading
Evaluation of students will be a holistic evaluation without any strict marking scheme and graded assignments. Students will be judged on the basis of contributive and collaborative skills expressed by them during the course.


## Project
The student will be asked to pick a project from a list of topics. The projects will mostly be explorative in nature. Every project will be executed by a team of at most 2 people. Evaluation of the project will be based on the report and presentation.
